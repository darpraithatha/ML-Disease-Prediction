# ML-Disease-Prediction
Diseas Covered as of Now:
       
       1. Heart Diseade
       2. Diabetes
        
## 1. Heart Disease

The cardiovascular Death are the major cause of Death Globally resulting approximately in to 30% of the total Deaths. According the survey 90 % of these can be prevented.

The Objective of this Project is to take a closer look at the data and to predict the chance of occurrence based on the various features (Risk Factors) responsible for the Disease.

The Data set used here is taken from UCI ML Repository [Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).

Project Overview:

    1.Data Set Structure.
    2.Data Cleaning.
    3.Applying Machine Learning Algorithms
    4.Conclusion
    
We will predidict using 2 Algorithms Linear Regression and Random Forest, compare their accuracy and will conclude which one is the best among these 2)

## 2. Diabetes

The Diabetes is a disease in which the body’s ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin is impaired, resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood and urine.

Origin mid 16th century: via Latin from Greek, literally ‘siphon,’ from diabainein ‘go through’; mellitus is from Latin mellitus ‘sweet.’

The Objective of this Project is to take a closer look at the data and to predict the chance of occurance based on the various features (Risk Factors) responsible for the Disease.

The Data set used here is taken from UCI ML Repository [Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/).

Project Overview:

    1.Data Set Structure.
    2.Data Cleaning.
    3.Applying Machine Learning Algorithms
    4.Conclusion

We will predidict using 3 Algorithms Linear Regression, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors compare their accuracy and will conclude which one is the best amoung these 3)
