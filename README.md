# ML-Disease-Prediction
The cardivascular Death are the major cause of Death Globally reasulting approxmately in to 30% of the total Deaths. According the the survey 90 % of these can be prevented.

The Objective of this Project is to take a closer look at the data and to predict the chance of occurance based on the various features (Risk Factors) responsible for the Disease.

Accordingly calculate the Insurance Premium for the following candidate.

The Data set used here is taken from UCI ML Repository [Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).

Project Overview:

    1.Data Set Structure.
    2.Data Cleaning.
    3.Applying Machine Learning Algorithms
    4.Conclusion
    
We will predidict using 2 Algorithms Linear Regression and Random Forest, compare their accuracy and will conclude which one is the best amoung this 2)
